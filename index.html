    <header><h1>Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity!</h1></header>
    <p>Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to expand your skillset, this is the perfect place to start your journey.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity is all about protecting our increasingly digital world. It encompasses safeguarding information systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This critical field ensures the CIA triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability – of information.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring only authorized individuals can access sensitive information. Encryption plays a crucial role here, scrambling data so only authorized users can decipher it.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Guaranteeing the accuracy and trustworthiness of data. Techniques like digital signatures help ensure data integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Making sure authorized users have access to information and systems whenever needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding these core principles is fundamental to grasping cybersecurity concepts.</p>

    <h2>Comprehensive Guide:</h2>
    <p>This guide provides a roadmap to navigate this ever-evolving field. We'll explore foundational topics, highlight valuable resources, and showcase opportunities to develop your skills. Remember, the key is to learn at your own pace, focus on practical understanding, and actively assess your progress.</p>

    <p>Forget about chasing certifications – let's build your cybersecurity expertise together! For self-motivated learners, tackling Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges offers a fun way to test your newfound knowledge. We'll delve deeper into CTFs later, so stay tuned.</p>

                      <h2>History of Incident Response Jobs</h2>
                      <p>The first massive denial-of-service (Dos) attack took place in 1988, when Robert Tappan Morris created the first internet virus. The Morris Worm affected approximately 6,000 computers and cost between $200 and $53,000 to remove the virus from each infected computer.</p>
                      <p>Such was the impact of the Morris Worm that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT), which is now part of the Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute.</p>
                      <p>Today, every company — regardless of its size or scale — maintains an incident response team or practices to mitigate cybersecurity threats. There are also federal regulations that require many industries to have incident response plans. With increased digitization of services, incident response has become more vital, opening up newer career opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate certification validates that you can manage identity and access, implement platform protection, manage security operations, and secure data and applications. This certification involves implementing, managing, and monitoring security for resources in Azure, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Azure Security Engineers are cybersecurity professionals who use Azure to protect their clients' data. Their responsibilities include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implementing security controls and threat protection</li>
                        <li>Managing identity and access</li>
                        <li>Protecting data, applications, and networks in cloud and hybrid environments</li>
                        <li>Developing and deploying cloud security frameworks in Azure environments</li>
                        <li>Working with senior IT security team members to create and implement new cybersecurity strategies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The Microsoft security engineer certification path has three levels: Fundamentals, Associate, and Expert. The Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate certification requires Exam AZ-500.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can prepare for the Azure Security Engineer Associate certification with self-paced training or instructor-led training. Self-paced training is less expensive and allows you to customize your learning experience based on your interests and needs. Instructor-led training provides the instructor's real-world experience.
